# webscraper practice

This very simple scraper based on the tutorial at [Socket.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js). x
The tutorial is a bit behind on what the IMDB DOM actually looks like as of 9/26/2016 and so required a bit of fiddling. This scraper isn't even terribly function at this point. But I learned the lessons I needed to go on to do work I want.
